## Create a GCP Compute Engine instance

Create a GCP Compute Engine instance with the appropriate machine type and storage size for the application. Use Terraform to create the instance and ensure that best practices such as setting up firewall rules and configuring logging are implemented.

## Set up a GCP Cloud Storage Bucket

Set up a GCP Cloud Storage Bucket using Terraform. Ensure that the bucket is configured with appropriate access control settings and logging is enabled.

## Create a GCP Kubernetes Cluster

Create a GCP Kubernetes Cluster using Terraform. Ensure that the cluster is configured with appropriate access control settings and logging is enabled.

## Set up a GCP Cloud SQL Instance

Set up a GCP Cloud SQL Instance using Terraform. Ensure that the instance is configured with appropriate access control settings and logging is enabled.

## Configure IAM roles for users

Configure IAM roles for users using Terraform to grant them appropriate access to resources in the cloud environment.

## Set up monitoring and alerting

Set up monitoring and alerting using Terraform to ensure that any issues or changes in the environment are detected quickly.

## Deploy an application on App Engine

Deploy an application on App Engine using Terraform and ensure that best practices such as configuring logging are implemented.

## Configure Networking Resources

Configure Networking Resources such as VPCs, subnets, routes etc using Terraform to ensure proper segmentation of resources in the cloud environment.

## Backup data stored in Cloud Storage Buckets

Backup data stored in Cloud Storage Buckets using Terraform to ensure data integrity in case of any unexpected events or disasters.

## Migrate existing applications to GCP

Migrate existing applications to GCP using Terraform and ensure that all necessary components such as networking resources are configured correctly for optimal performance of the application in the cloud environment.

Tasks around databases: Set up replication for database instances; Monitor database performance; Automate backup of database instances; Create database users; Configure security policies for databases; Monitor database logs; Maintain database indices; Automate patching of databases; Perform regular maintenance tasks on databases; Configure high availability for databases.

Tasks related to DevOps: Set up version control system (e.g., Git); Implement semantic versioning (e.g., SemVer); Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines; Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) principles (e.g., use of terraform); Implement GitOps workflows (e.g., use of GitHub Actions); Configure automated testing frameworks (e.g., use of Jest); Create automated deployment scripts (e.g., use of Ansible); Monitor system performance metrics (e.g., use of Prometheus); Implement security best practices (e
