## Create a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform

Create a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform using Terraform. Ensure that the cluster is configured to use best practices for security and scalability.

## Deploy an application to the Kubernetes cluster

Deploy an application to the Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Ensure that the application is configured to use best practices for security and scalability.

## Monitor the Kubernetes cluster

Monitor the Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana. Ensure that all metrics are being collected and monitored in real time.

## Automate deployment of applications to the Kubernetes cluster

Automate deployment of applications to the Kubernetes cluster using Jenkins or other CI/CD tools. Ensure that all deployments are done securely and consistently.

## Configure logging for the Kubernetes cluster

Configure logging for the Kubernetes cluster using ELK stack or other logging solutions. Ensure that all logs are being collected and stored securely.

## Configure backups of data stored in the Kubernetes cluster

Configure backups of data stored in the Kubernetes cluster using tools such as Velero or other backup solutions. Ensure that all backups are done securely and regularly scheduled according to best practices.

## Maintain databases in the cloud

Maintain databases in the cloud using tools such as RDS or other database solutions. Ensure that all databases are configured with best practices for security and performance optimization.

## Perform regular maintenance tasks on databases

Perform regular maintenance tasks on databases such as indexing, defragmentation, etc., using tools such as SQL Server Management Studio or other database management tools. Ensure that all maintenance tasks are done according to best practices for security and performance optimization

## Implement semantic versioning for applications deployed in cloud environments

Implement semantic versioning for applications deployed in cloud environments using version control systems such as Git or other version control solutions. Ensure that all versions are tracked accurately and consistently according to best practices

## Implement GitOps workflows for applications deployed in cloud environments

Implement GitOps workflows for applications deployed in cloud environments using tools such as Jenkins X or other CI/CD solutions. Ensure that all deployments are done securely and consistently according to best practices
