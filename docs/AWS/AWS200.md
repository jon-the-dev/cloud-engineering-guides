### Implement IAM

Create an IAM user using Terraform. Grant the user access to the S3 bucket created in Ticket 5. Assign the user the necessary permissions to list, read, and write objects in the bucket. Implement security best practices like using strong passwords, implementing least privilege, and enabling MFA for the user.

## AWS DB Services

### Implement Aurora Database

Create an Aurora Database Cluster using Terraform. Use the MySQL-compatible database engine. Use the db.t2.small instance type. Configure the instance to allow inbound traffic on port 3306. Use an encrypted storagevolume for the Aurora cluster. Implement security best practices like limiting access, using secure passwords, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

### Implement CloudFront

Create a CloudFront distribution using Terraform. Configure the distribution to use the S3 bucket created in Ticket 5 as the origin. Implement security best practices like limiting access, using secure passwords, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

## AWS Best Practices

### Perform Regular System Maintenance

Create an AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Window using Terraform. Configure the maintenance window to run once a month. Implement a maintenance plan that includes OS and application patching, disk cleanup, and other regular maintenance tasks. Implement security best practices like limiting access, using secure passwords, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

### Implement GitOps Workflow

Set up a Git repository using Terraform. Create a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Configure the cluster to use the Git repository as the source of truth for deployments. Implement security best practices like limiting access, using secure passwords, and encrypting data at rest and in transit.

### Implement Continuous Integration
