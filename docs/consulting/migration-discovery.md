# Lab: Discovery for a Migration Project from a Datacenter to the Cloud

[TOC]

## Overview

This lab will teach you how to do discovery for a migration project from a data center to the cloud. You will learn about the different tools and techniques available for discovering your existing infrastructure and applications, as well as how to use them to plan and execute your migration project.

## Objectives

At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Identify the different tools and techniques available for discovery in a migration project.
- Use Terraform and Serverless Framework to discover existing infrastructure and applications.
- Plan and execute your migration project using the information gathered during discovery.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this lab, you should have:

- A basic understanding of Terraform and Serverless Framework.
- Access to an existing data center or cloud environment.

## Tasks

1.  **Identify Tools & Techniques** - Identify the different tools and techniques available for discovering your existing infrastructure and applications in order to plan and execute your migration project. Some examples include using Terraform or Serverless Framework for infrastructure discovery or using application profiling tools such as AppDynamics or New Relic for application discovery.

2.  **Use Terraform & Serverless Framework** - Use Terraform and Serverless Framework to discover existing infrastructure components such as servers, databases, storage systems, networks, etc., as well as any applications running on those components. This can be done by writing code that queries APIs or by manually inspecting each component individually.

3.  **Plan & Execute Migration** - Once you have identified all of the components that need to be migrated, use this information to plan out your migration strategy. This should include details such as which components need to be migrated first, what order they should be migrated in, what resources are needed for each component, etc., so that you can ensure a successful migration with minimal disruption of services.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to do discovery for a migration project from a data center to the cloud by identifying different tools and techniques available for discovering existing infrastructure and applications, using Terraform and Serverless Framework for discovery purposes, and planning out your migration strategy based on the information gathered during discovery. With this knowledge in hand, you are now ready to begin planning out your own cloud migrations!
