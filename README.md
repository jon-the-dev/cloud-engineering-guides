# cloud-engineering-labs

There are many facets to Cloud Engineering. As I work with more and more engineers on learning and expanding their cloud skills, I figured it would be good to start documenting these here.

Great cloud engineers come from great Devops engineers. So we should break that down a little. What makes a good DevOps engineer? Ill start with saying that engineers with a wide variety of skills are better suited for challenges in the cloud compared to someone that is an expert in a few domains.

Areas to focus on:
- OS
- Databases and Caching
- Networking & Automation
- Monitoring & Logging
- Configuration Management
- Security & Reliability
- Development Automation
- IaC
- Containers
- Serverless
- Agile & Scrum
